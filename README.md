# Metadata-Remover
This application is a command line tool used to remove image metadata in a selected directory. The application allows the user to choose which metadata profiles to delete or delete them all. The quality of the output image can also be adjusted. After processing each file, the application writes the new image without metadata to a subdirectory "WithoutMetadata" within the original directory of images. The application has a simple user interface and uses the ImageMagick library to process the images.
